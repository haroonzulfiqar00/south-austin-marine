("Seager") hereby leases to the customer and the customer leases from Seager certain space to be assigned by Seager which shall be solely for the storage of customer's boat, hereinafter described, for the term beginning Sept. 1st, 2025, and ending on June 30th, 2026, upon the following terms and conditions:</p>
                <ol class="contract-list">
                    <li>Any granting of storage space hereunder is with the distinct understanding, and the applicant hereby agrees that Seager Marine, Inc. assumes no responsibility for the safety of the vessel stored during the dates above. Seager will not be liable for fire, theft, or damage to said vessel, its equipment, or any property in or on said vessel, unless due to Seager gross negligence. The applicant further agrees that the dry land space rental of any vessel hereunder shall be at his own risk.</li>
                    <li>Boat owners must remove all items from boat prior to storage. This includes, but is not limited to, boat lines, lifejackets, watersport boards, fenders, paperwork/documents, etc. Seager will not be responsible for any items left in the boat at the time of storage. If items are on the boat at the time of storage it will be assumed the owner is aware of their presence and understand the implied risk of leaving such items on the boat including damage, theft, or other loss due to mildew, fire, etc.</li>
                    <li>Boat owners must maintain adequate insurance on their vessel during the winter storage period. A minimum of Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000.00) liability insurance and full replacement value of the vessel insurance, while the boat is transported and stored at Seager, must be provided by the owner. Seager will not be responsible for injuries (including death) or property damage resulting from the use of marina facilities, unless due to Seager gross negligence.</li>
                    <li>Boats, motors, trailers and equipment of any kind, or articles placed in storage for repair or otherwise in possession of Seager are not insured by Seager All personal accessory articles and/or equipment of value should be removed from the boat before the storage procedure is started. We agree to use precaution to prevent loss or damage to the boat accessories, but we are not responsible for loss or damage, as may arise from fire, flood, windstorm, malicious mischief, or any other conditions beyond our control.</li>
                    <li>All winter storage fees are due in full to Seager at the time the vessel is placed into storage unless you are a slip customer and on a payment program. Charges can be placed on the customer's credit card which must be on file with Seager when the reservation is made for storage, or the customer can make other arrangements for payment. Regardless, payment is due on the date Seager's takes possession of the boat for storage.</li>
                    <li>If the customer fails to pay storage due hereunder or fails to remove the boat as required hereunder the terms hereof, the customer shall be liable for all storage fees due and additional costs and expenses incurred by the reason of the customers default, and further, will pay to Seager reasonable attorney's fees incurred by reason of the customer's default.
